Ben Tenyson A normal teen guy, who with the help of a watch-like gadget called omnitrix saves the people. 
 
Ben adjusts the dial of the omnitrix to choose between aliens and slams the dial to confirm the alien of his choice. 
The omnitrix had recently been added the feature of scanning any creature and adding them to its database. 
Ben after joining the The Avengers, has some updates on omnitrix and now he can change aliens on his wish. 
And the time of him being in an alien form which was limited previously, now had been changed to no limits.
Some technical additions have also been made to the aliens in the omnitrix, to power them more. 

Research in labs have also been progressing to develop more similar ones to that of omnitrix,by taking experiments with the one that of ben.
